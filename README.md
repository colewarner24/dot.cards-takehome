Overall I finished the 4 API calls using node and express. I used a SQLite server instance stored locally and typescript jest to run the tests. 

I used a test-driven development style to code each API call and the database functions.

To further development in a real concurrent server, I would need to add compatibility for CORS and also a way of authorizing the client (key and certs).
I would also add a way of dealing with server errors that would alert the client and not halt the server.

I had never used typescript before this challenge so I did not utilize all of its typing features but I prefer the benefits of a typed language over base javascript.
